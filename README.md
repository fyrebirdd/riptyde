# riptide
A Javascript 3D library based on WebGPU

## Project Goals
I want to make a tool that is as easy to use as three.js but allows the user the ability to use compute shaders. 

## How to install
Currently the project isn't in a state where it works properly for the user yet, but once it does it will be on the npm database and will be installable with ```npm install riptyde```.
